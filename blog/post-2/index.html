Some of the research done on darknet websites states that, attackers and criminals are moving more towards stealing credit card information from travel, sports events related fraud or even banking related frauds. Because of the pandemic situation, most of the gathering and international travels are cancelled. So that leaves less room for travel related cyber attacks or frauds like selling concert tickets at a lower price. Bank related frauds are failing because drop workers, i.e. somebody who works for the attackers to collect the money from the bank, deposited into an attacker&rsquo;s account fraudulently, are in quarantine. This topic is on the news because Covid-19 has affected every sector in one way or the other and cybersecurity is not an exception.</p><p>On the other side, According to TransUnion research, after declaring covid-19 a pandemic phenomenon, the e-commerce transactions have increased by 23 percent within a week.[1] This increases the chances of being attacked online. If the volume of the transactions is large, it becomes more difficult to attribute a cyber attack. Thus, attackers are moving to stealing credit card information. Also, cybercriminals who are well-versed with routing the user to a malicious domain from a genuine site and propagating malwares are getting more targets than before. Because being quarantined is making people browse more on the internet.</p><p>Due to these pandemic situations, most of the IT companies have allowed their employees to work from home. In these situations, employees are connected to their respective office network, sometimes using their personal device, which is less protected than the company owned device. To let employees connect to the office network, security protocols have been loosened. In remote working, most people use devices unknown to the office network so an attacker can pretend to have a different identity to penetrate the office network, and the security team won’t be easily able to notice them. Number of phishing attacks in Italy have also been increasing since the covid-19 outbreak [2].</p><p>Some attackers see this as an opportunity by spreading false news about covid-19 [3]. These kinds of false news would force people to panic and make wrong decisions, for example, phishing email about buying a subscription to vaccine-coronavirus[.]com [4] website which is a fake.</p><h3 id=cyber-crimes-in-cloud-space>Cyber crimes in cloud space:</h3><p>Most companies and large chains are moving to cloud as it is easily accessible and you pay only for the services you use. That’s a good cost effective measure for big industries. But cloud space is not entirely secure. Most cyber attacks take advantage of the errors or vulnerabilities left open by the humans configuring the cloud space. Thus keeping track of security protocols and enhanced security measures are a must when it comes to migrating an application to cloud.</p><p>In the recent news mentioned in New York Times on 19th Feb, the casino and hotel giant, MGM resorts reported a serious data breach about their customers. Victims included high profile customers including Twitter’s chief executive. The attack stole personal information including name, address, phone numbers, ID information, etc. According to Times, almost 10.6 million[5] people were affected by the data breach.
This is an example of data breach in cloud storage.</p><p>MGM is not the only example but it has followed an example of another series of attacks happened in Marriott International in 2018 [6]. The data that got leaked was not encrypted. The second attack happened on Marriott International on 1st April 2020, again exposing 5.2 millions user records. What could be done to prevent such a thing? A security personnel taking charge of cloud space should be well-aware of what kind of security an application needs. For example, if an application is deployed on AWS cloud servers, unauthorized access to servers should immediately be reported and the IP should be black-listed. Also, application testing should be done thoroughly, to mitigate the possibilities of cross-scripting attacks. Users data should be encrypted and the decryption key should be stored somewhere safe.</p><p>According to a Forbes article[7], 20% of enterprise data is present on the cloud and in the year 2020, 17% rise in the number is expected. With increased data, the attack surface of clouds also increases. On 3rd March 2020, a Google cloud database consisting of 800 GB data of around 200 million customers got leaked. Why such topics are on the news, because this data breach story proves that even big names like GCP or AWS are not enough to justify the security of data stored on public clouds. It’s very important for every company to follow certain security protocols and they should also have data breach recovery actions defined before deploying an application on any cloud platform, may it be private or public.</p><h3 id=smear-campaigns-and-cyber-attacks>Smear campaigns and cyber attacks</h3><p>In the recent news and some articles about an application called Houseparty, a video chatting and gaming app, claims that when this app is installed on your phone, it hacks into the user’s Netflix and Spotify accounts. According to the article posted in Express on the 1st of April 2020 [8], thousands of users are claiming that the houseparty app steals user credentials and hacks into Netflix and Spotify accounts. Also, these users urged others to delete the app from their phones.</p><p>Last June. this application was bought by Epic games, and the downloads skyrocketed since then. On 4th April, Houseparty refuted all the claims, they said that this is all a smear campaign to defame the application and they are offering a reward of 1 million USD [9] to an individual who can provide the evidence for the existence of the smear campaign.</p><p>Why is this on the news? It’s because there was a sudden wave of tweets made to defame the company. There is no evidence yet to prove whether the hacks actually happened or it was a smear campaign. But according to Epic games, it’s almost impossible to break into Netflix and Spotify accounts from the application.A cyber security expert also confirmed that houseparty being unsafe has not been confirmed by a reliable security firm.</p><p>Smear campaigns using cyber crimes is not an unusual phenomenon. Sometimes it could be a political party spreading propagandas or personal motives. Or sometimes the actual attacker can also hide behind the smear campaign&rsquo;s motives. The WannaCry ransomware attack devised in 2017 was a global attack and it was attributed to North Korea. North Korea denied the attribution and also blamed it on the U.S. &lsquo;s smear campaign strategy [10]. There is no evidence to prove this claim either.</p><p>It would be interesting to see how this news unfolds further but from the current scenario, it seems that there is no reason to uninstall the Houseparty app. The spokesperson of Epic games broke out a tweet saying the twitter accounts which started the rumours are suspended and the original tweets have been deleted. But despite this being a fake news, smear campaign did manage to reduce the number of downloads of the app cause most users would feel that it’s better to be safe than sorry.</p><h4 id=references>References:</h4><p>[1]https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/news-archive/coronavirus/covid-19-hurts-travel-and-event-fraudsters-but-buoys-online-carding-schemes/?web_view=true</p><p>[2]https://threatpost.com/cynet-the-coronavirus-is-already-taking-effect-on-cyber-security-this-is-how-cisos-should-prepare/153758/</p><p>[3]https://securityboulevard.com/2020/03/the-coronavirus-impacts-on-cybersecurity/</p><p>[4]https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/03/12/coronavirus-scam-alert-watch-out-for-these-risky-covid-19-websites-and-emails/#384e3f4b1099</p><p>[5]https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/us/mgm-data-breach.html?auth=linked-google&searchResultPosition=7</p><p>[6] <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/marriott-hack-passports.html>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/marriott-hack-passports.html</a></p><p>[7]https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2020/02/05/more-cloud-more-hacks-pt-1/#457db5da3e58</p><p>[8]https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/1262472/Houseparty-Warning-Video-Chat-iPhone-Android-Dangerous-Flaw-Login-Data</p><p>[9]https://www.itnews.com.au/news/video-chat-app-houseparty-offers-us1-million-reward-over-hacking-claims-545862</p><p>[10]https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-cybercrime/north-korea-says-u-s-accusation-of-hacking-a-smear-campaign-idUSKCN1LU04R</p></div></div></div></div></section><footer class="bg-dark footer-section"><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-md-4><h5 class=text-light>Email</h5><p class="text-white paragraph-lg font-secondary">asawari44@gmail.com</p></div><div class=col-md-4><h5 class=text-light>Phone</h5><p class="text-white paragraph-lg font-secondary">+358 417269091</p></div><div class=col-md-4><h5 class=text-light>Address</h5><p class="text-white paragraph-lg font-secondary">Stockholm, Sweden 170 70</p></div></div></div><div class="border-top text-center border-dark py-5"><p class="mb-0 text-light"></p></div></footer><script src=https://asawari44.github.io/MyPortfolio/plugins/jQuery/jquery.min.js></script><script src=https://asawari44.github.io/MyPortfolio/plugins/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://asawari44.github.io/MyPortfolio/plugins/slick/slick.min.js></script><script src=https://asawari44.github.io/MyPortfolio/plugins/shuffle/shuffle.min.js></script><script src=https://asawari44.github.io/MyPortfolio/plugins/google-map/map.js></script><script src=https://asawari44.github.io/MyPortfolio/js/script.min.js></script></body></html>
