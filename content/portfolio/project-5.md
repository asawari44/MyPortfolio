#### Project Requirements
The project was about coming up with a feasible business idea that identifies and solves one of the sustainable development goals. we were a team of 5 working on the project and it involved brainstorming to coming up with the idea, calculating the market size, required budget, pitching the idea in front of the investors, financial planning,user research for idea validation, prototyping and business landing page creation.  

#### Project Details
We came up with the idea of Blazera, a solution to help fire fighters combat forest fires more efficiently. Our solution proposes a mapping tool for fire marshalls to keep track of their teams and plan the best strategy to fight fires considering the location of the water resources in the nearby area and accessibility to fire fighting units.
