#### Project Requirements

The objective of the project was to create an Android application for task management. The backend and frontend needed to be written either in Kotlin or Java. gitlab CI was used for collaborating and continuous integration of the code. CI pipeline triggered on every commit and it would build the gradle. The backend would trigger certain APIs exposed using GCP cloud platform and firebase was used as a database to store user and task related data.


#### Project Details

The duration of the project was 2 months. My responsibility was to provide CI on gitlab CI so that other developers in the team can collaborate and build functionalities together. I also created some modules in the backend using Java with andorid SDK libraries. In those modules, my task was to communicate with firebase to save and retrive user related information. I also had to call APIs exposed on a virtual machine deployed on GCP cloud. I created Terraform script to provision a VM on the fly and to automate the VM creation process. 

Our work was highly appreciated by our examiners and we eneded up getting the maximum grade on the course.
