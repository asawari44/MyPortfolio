Hi! I am Asa, 28, has a master's degree in the field of Cloud and Network infrastructures along with a minor in Business and startup ecosystems, and currently working at Volvo cars, Stockholm, Sweden. I am living in Stockholm since 2019 and I absolutely love it here!
I worked at Great software laboratories, Pune, India, for 3 years straight after I got my bachelor's degree in computer science and then moved to Finland to pursue my master's degree. I, then ended up in Stockholm to finish my degree and was working at Infor Stockholm AB for almost 2 years. I then joined Volvo cars to gain more expertise and experience in different areas of cloud technologies.
Here at Volvo cars, I mainly work on upcoming and fast-growing technologies such as ArgoCD, Crospplane, Golang, etc.
