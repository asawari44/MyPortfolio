Hi! I am Asa, and currently I am pursuing a master's degree in the field of Cloud and Network infrastructures along with a minor in Business and startup ecosystems. It's a joint degree designed by European Institute of Technology(EIT) which offers mobility program across Europe. I studied first year of my degree at Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland and currently I am studying my final year at KTH Royal institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.   

My academic grades and a keen understanding of Networking domain led me to bag a well-paying and enviable job at ‘Great Software Laboratories Pvt.Ltd.’. In this company, I got the opportunity to work on different cloud platforms such as OpenStack, AWS, GCP, etc. I flourished as a DevOps Engineer under the wings of my lead and my fellow engineers. I got the opportunity to work on a variety of projects which involved interaction with foreign clients and an understanding of their requirements clearly. My role was to create and maintain CI/CD toolchain using DevOps and Cloud technologies.

After working at the firm for three years, I realized that there are quite a few uncharted waters for me in the field of Cloud and Networking Infrastructure, such as blockchains, distributed ledger applications and cybersecurity. I decided to look for courses that can give me in-depth knowledge about these unexplored territories and I came across EIT digital master school. The combined master's degree in the domain that aligns with my previous work at two different universities with a full-time scholarship enticed me to move to Europe and build a profound understanding of Networking.
